# Gladiator_Arena

Ever wondered how you'd fare in one-on-one combat? Test your wits and your luck (although not your actual health) against a series of opposing challengers in Gladiator Arena!

Choose your difficulty setting, armor, weapon, and a concoction of performance enhancing consumables (don't worry; they're absolutely legal) and see if you can survive a harrowing gauntlet of challengers. After defeating an opponent, you'll have the option to pick up any goods they've left behind and use them in future fights. But don't worry; if you're not too interested in a particular item you'll always have the option to sell it for some cold, hard cash in one of the shops surrounding the arena--although we can't guarantee you'll get a fair price...

Just fire up gladiator_arena.py, and you'll be well on your way! Best of luck!
